ADReports
=========
Generate reports from Active Directory (AD).

Description
-----------
ADReports provides tools to generate reports from Active Directory (AD) via LDAP.
These reports are useful to manage Active Directory, but also to improve compliancy for audits (e.g. due diligence, Sarbanesâ€“Oxley Act (SOX)).

The library was written with the following goals in mind:
- portable across different platforms (Windows, *nix)
- cross platform (using either native Windows LDAP or OpenLDAP)
